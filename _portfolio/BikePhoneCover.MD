### Description
###
 Writeup including (>500 words):
▪ A description of top-down modeling and how it was leveraged in this
assignment.
▪ Rationale behind your design
• What type of rotation mechanism did you use? Does it work well?
• Did you have to change any dimensions to account for the 3D
printing process?
• What type of 3D printing did you use? Why?
▪ Brief Assembly/use instructions
▪ Which printing technology and why did you use for each part?
o Embedded Interactive CAD model
o Figures:
▪ Real-life picture(s) of printed model in use on bike handlebars.
▪ Real-life .GIF of the holder rotating between landscape and portrait
▪ Fusion Rendering of phone holder with phone on it.
▪ Cross-section view of internal rotation mechanism. This can be a
screenshot of the design workspace with the section analysis tool.
