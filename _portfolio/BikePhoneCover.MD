## Project Overview

This project features a 3D-printed phone holder designed to attach to bike handlebars. The design incorporates a spring-loaded detent mechanism that allows the phone to snap securely between orientations without the need for tools. Developed for both powder SLS and filament printing, the design was iteratively refined to optimize tolerances and clearances for a tight fit and durable assembly. The phone holder mounts to standard handlebars and remains stable during motion.

## Design Rationale
This phone holder was designed around two primary goals: functionality as a phone holder with ability to rotate between portrait and landscape orientations, and ability to be manufactured with available rapid prototyping methods.  When designing, a top-down modeling approach was used to establish correct fit with the given part dimensions and ensure components fit together smoothly. The top-down method involves starting with the overall assembly, using fixed referencesâ€”such as the handle bar and phone-to define the spatial relationships between other components.  Individual parts were then modeled around these references to ensue precise fit and alignment. In essence, the top-down approach ensured the final holder functiond with the constrainsts of the given part dimensions, namely the handle bar diameter, phone size, and ball and spring detent parts.

A key feature of the design is the rotation mechanism, which uses a spring-loaded detent system to let the phone rotate cleanly between portrait and landscape orientations. The detents provide tactile feedback and help keep the phone stable. During early testing, however, it became clear that small forces on the handle bar-forces that would occur with normal riding condition-introduced enough vibration and jarring forces to sometimes cause unintended rotation of the detent mechanism. To address this, the spring stiffness was increased, and a slot feature (seen in the figure below) was created to further increase the springe force by increasing the compression the spring. A stiffer spring raised the force required to rotate the phone, preventing it from shifting unless deliberately adjusted by the user.

Another important aspect of the design was achieving a secure grip on the phone. To address this, two solutions were implemented:
1. A stretchable TPU grip that conforms around the edges of the phone to hold it in place.
2. A sliding clamp mechanism that adjusts to different phone sizes.
Both features work together to secure the device firmly without the need for tools. 


## Assembly & Use Instructions

## 3D Printing Process

The phone mount assembly was created using components manufactured using both SLS and FFF 3D printing methods, selected based on functional requirements and material performance.  

High-stress and precision-critical parts (such as the Lower and Upper Handlebar Clamps, Detent Base, and Detent Housing) were fabricated using **Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)** with nylon. This provided more strength (specificaly between layers), durability, and fine feature resolution.

To integrate threaded brass inserts, holes in SLS-printed components were intentionally undersized, allowing for post-processing by adding heat-set inserts. This  ensured a tight mechanical fit for reliable threaded connections.

Components produced with **Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)**, including the Phone Mount Frame, Slider, and TPU-based parts, were designed with **additional hole clearance** to compensate for common FFF printing tolerances and slight dimensional inaccuracies.

The flexible elements, such as the Phone Mount Band and TPU Phone Grip, were printed using thin TPU layers to maximize stretch and elasticity. This allowed the parts to maintain strong retention while adapting to various phone sizes without needing tools.
