## Project Overview

This project features a 3D-printed phone holder designed to attach to bike handlebars. The design incorporates a spring-loaded detent mechanism that allows the phone to snap securely between orientations without the need for tools. Developed for both powder SLS and filament printing, the design was iteratively refined to optimize tolerances and clearances for a tight fit and durable assembly. The phone holder mounts to standard handlebars and remains stable during motion.

## Final Product

## Design Rationale
This phone holder was built around two primary goals: functionality as a phone holder with ability to rotate between portrait and landscape orientations, and ability to be manufactured with available rapid prototyping methods.  When Designing, a top-down modeling approach was used to establish correct fit with the given part dimensions and ensure components fit together smoothly. The tope-down method involves starting with the overall assembly, using fixed referencesâ€”such as the handle bar and phone-to define the spatial relationships between other components.  Individual parts are then modeled around these references to ensue precise fit and alignment. In essence, the top-down approach ensured the final product would work withing the given part dimensions-specifically the handle bar diameter, phone size, and ball and spring detent dimensions.

A key feature of the design is the rotation mechanism, which uses a spring-loaded detent system to let the phone snap cleanly between portrait and landscape orientations. The detents provide tactile feedback and help keep the phone stable. During early testing, however, it became clear that normal riding introduced enough vibration and jarring forces to sometimes cause unintended rotation. To address this, the spring stiffness was increased. A stiffer spring raised the force required to rotate the phone, preventing it from shifting unless deliberately adjusted by the user. This significantly improved stability on rough terrain or during sudden movements.

The mount is compatible with standard 22.2 mm and 25.4 mm handlebars. The phone-gripping arms are shaped to hold the device securely without the need for tools. Parametric modeling was used throughout, allowing for quick adjustments to part clearances, screw placements, and spring locations based on testing and 3D printing results.

Several iterations were printed using FDM to fine-tune mechanical fit and part interactions. Final components needing greater strength and a smoother finish were produced using powder printing.
