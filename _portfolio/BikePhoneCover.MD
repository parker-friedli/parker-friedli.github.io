## Project Overview
This project features a 3D-printed phone holder designed to attach to bike handlebars using a top-down modeling workflow in Fusion 360. The design incorporates a spring-loaded detent mechanism, to enable the phone to snap securely between orientations without tools. Designed for both powder SLS and filament printing, I iteratively refined tolerances and clearances to achieve a tight fit, and durable assembly. The phone holder attaches to standard handlebars and stays stable and in place while in motion.
