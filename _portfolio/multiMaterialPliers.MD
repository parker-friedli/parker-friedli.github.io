* Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. 
* Perform external research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What combination of materials work well for print-in-place?
#


# CAD Model

# Design Description
* About the design and iterative process (e.g., how was the spring component created and how is it retained in the model, 
* materials used)
* Relevant specifications of the pliers (jaw length, jaw capacity)
