### Overview
This project focuses on creating functional print-in-place pliers that need no post-processing or assembly. These pliers are designed to grip and pick up through-hole resistors, with a *flexible spring component* that returns them to an open position when released.  

The success of print-in-place designs depends on **precise clearances between moving parts to ensure smooth operation right after printing. While extrusion-based 3D printing can create inconsistencies that lead to stiff or "crunchy" movement, this design solves that challenge by using a separately printed flexible spring component. This addition improves both the pliers' range of motion and durability.

###  What Are Print-in-Place Models?
Print-in-place (PIP) designs enable the creation of complex, multi-component mechanisms in a single, ready-to-use print. These designs excel in applications featuring articulating joints, hinges, or interlocking components. Common examples include:  

- 3D-printed adjustable wrenches
- Functional ball-bearing assemblies
- Hinged enclosures
- Snap-fit connectors for robotics

PIP designs require precise clearances and print orientation to prevent component fusion during printing. Moreover, multi-material printing can add flexibility to specific areas of the design, enhancing functionality.  

  **Aplicaitons for PIP**
  - Articulated Models
  - Mechanical Components
  - Integrated Mechanisms

  **Material Combinations for PIP**
