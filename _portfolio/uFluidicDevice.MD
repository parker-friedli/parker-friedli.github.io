# Introduction to uFluidic Devices
Microfluidic devices are systems that use small amounts of fluids which manipulate through channels ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. These channels function as small pipes that control flow, allowing for experimentation and analysis which extreme precision. These devices have allowed various fields, including biology, chemistry, and medicine, through the precise flow, rapid analysis, and minimizing reagent consumption; in essence functioning as a small Lab on a chip. [1]

uFluidic devices can be designed to serve various functions includingâ€¦

* **Mixing**: These microscale channels enable precise fluid blending and combination, which is essential for conducting chemical processes and preparing samples for analysis
* **Chemical Reactions**: The microfluidic chamber's controlled environment enables precise chemical reactions for drug discovery and material synthesis
* **Separation**: Some devices can separate components within a mixture based on size, density, or other properties.

# Operating Instructions
1. Insert a syringe (5 mL or 20 mL) into the holder and secure it using the strap.
2. In the Arduino code, set the syringe size (1 for 20mL, 2 for 5mL) and desired flow rate (mL per minute).
3. Upload the code to the Arduino and power on the pump.
4. Press the "On/Off" button to start the pump, indicated by the green LED.
5. Press the button again to pause the pump (yellow LED).
6. Once the syringe is empty, the red LED will activate. Press the reverse button to reset the pump (purple LED).
7. Once reversed, the pump is ready for another cycle, indicated by the yellow LED.
