## Education

* Vanderbilt University
  * BS Mechanical Engineering
  * Minor in Digital Fabrication

## Technical Skills
Parker can operate a variety of computer-controlled (CNC) fabrication tools to transform 3D models into real-life parts. She has experience with the following additive manufacturing technologies:

* Material Extrusion: Proficient in using 3D printers that deposit material layer by layer to build objects, commonly known as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). 

* Vat Photopolymerization: Experienced with technologies like stereolithography (SLA) that cure liquid photopolymer resin using a light source to form solid parts. 

* Powder Bed Fusion: Familiar with processes that use thermal energy to fuse powder particles, such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). 

These skills enable Parker to effectively produce high-quality components tailored to specific project requirements.
